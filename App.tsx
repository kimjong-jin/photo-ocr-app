// This file is renamed to PhotoLogPage.tsx
// For brevity, its content (which is the original App.tsx) is not duplicated here
// but should be moved to a new file PhotoLogPage.tsx and adjusted as needed.
// The key change is that it will become a component managed by PageContainer.
// See the new PhotoLogPage.tsx file for the actual content.

// Placeholder to satisfy the XML structure if this file path App.tsx is being replaced.
// In reality, this file would be deleted or renamed. For this exercise, we'll provide its new content under PhotoLogPage.tsx
