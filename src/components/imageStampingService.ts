import React, { useRef } from 'react';

// Content that caused errors (UploadIcon and ImageUpload components with JSX)
// has been removed because this is a .ts file, not a .tsx file,
// and the components appeared to be unused.
// If these components are needed, this file should be renamed to .tsx
// or the components should be rewritten without JSX.

// To make this a valid module, we export an empty object.
// The original React and useRef imports are kept in case they were intended
// for future non-JSX utility functions in this file, though they are currently unused.
